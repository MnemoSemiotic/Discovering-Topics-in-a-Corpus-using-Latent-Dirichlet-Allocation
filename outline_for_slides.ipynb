    "_This is a sort of meta-evaluation since it doesn't use LDA directly. If you're not familiar with KMeans, just think of it as a way to group similar rows of data into clusters. Since Kmeans breaks down at high dimensions, due to the curse of dimensionality, I use SVD to reduce the dimensions to 50 singular value components that represent the variance present in a sparse TFIDF matrix of the input._\n",

Keep in mind that, unlike LDA, KMeans does not assign a topic distribution to the documents, it only assigns a single cluster value, which is appended to each row so that we can see some color in the tSNE plots. The assumption being made here is that document similarity will be enough to discern an appropriate number of topics by way of choosing an optimal number of clusters. To decide on an appropriate number of clusters, we can use Elbow plots for the gap statistic or for the distortion. I've linked to resources for those from this slide, and with these metrics or by minimizing intracluster distances in KMeans, it's possible to automatically trigger a rebuild of the LDA model with a different number of topics._\n",

If you look at the repo linked from this slide, there are elbow and silhouette plots for various sample sizes of the corpus and for various values of K clusters. In fact, if you generate a corpus and want to run an LDA diagnostic on it, the scripts in the source repo should get you started. There's also a Flask-based recommender that you can plug in LDA, NMF or any other other model commonly used for recommenders. You'll have to modify it a bit for your use case. Eventually, I'm going to create an LDA auto-rebuild feature in that recommender as a proof of concept of taking human eyes off of the topic validation._\n",
